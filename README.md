# 05b-Exercises-pygame-physics

Here are some exercises to help you learn about how 2D game physics might be implemented. One exercise gives you a taste of how you might implement music and sound effects in a game.

This assumes that you have Pygame installed.

There are four exercise files in this repository. Follow the instructions in each of them to fulfill the exercise. Then commit your changes to your repository and push them back to GitHub.

Some of the exercises require you to interpret what is going on. Feel free to explore other variations until you can come up with a reasonable explanation. 

The repository includes two graphics files, adventurer.png and frameGuide.png. adventurer.png is a sprite sheet (used with exercise 3) and frameGuide.png is a breakdown of the frames in each animation sequence. They were created by created by [MoikMellah](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) and were provided under a Public Domain license.

The repository includes several sample music and sound files:

The music files that accompany this exercise are:

* [Chief_Inspector_Baldwin_ID_873](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Lobo_Loco/Long__Relaxed/Chief_Inspector_Baldwin_ID_873)
* [Ambient_Blues_Joe_ID_773](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Lobo_Loco/Long__Relaxed/Ambient_Blues_Joe_ID_773)

Both were composed and performed by Lobo Loco and distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License

The sound effects are:
